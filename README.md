Scam-A-Thon Project

About the Project

Hi, I‚Äôm Japneet Singh, and I created this website as part of a hackathon called Scam-A-Thon. This project demonstrates how phishing attacks can work, highlighting the importance of cybersecurity and data protection.

The website is built using React.js, HTML, and CSS to simulate an online shopping platform. As part of the demonstration, when a user enters personal details, the data is sent to a Discord webhook for analysis and ethical awareness purposes.

Technologies Used

React.js ‚Äì Frontend framework
HTML & CSS ‚Äì Styling and structure
Discord Webhooks ‚Äì Simulating data transmission for awareness
How It Works

A user interacts with the website and proceeds to checkout.
They enter personal details such as name, email, address, and payment information.
The entered details are sent to a Discord webhook (simulating a phishing attack).
This demonstrates how attackers might steal user data through fake websites.
